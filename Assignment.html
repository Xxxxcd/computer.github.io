	<p class="one">
		Canada is a country in the northern part of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering 9.98 million square kilometres (3.85 million square miles), making it the world's second-largest country by total area. Canada is a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy in the Westminster tradition, with a monarch and a prime minister who serves as the chair of the Cabinet and head of government.As a developed country, Canada has the seventeenth-highest nominal per-capita income globally as well as the thirteenth-highest ranking in the Human Development Index. Its advanced economy is the tenth-largest in the worldIn 2020, Canada is going to have 153 years of history. The population of Canada is mainly made up of immigrants. The immigrant population is 21.9% in 2016.</p><br>

	<p class="two">
		By total area (including its waters), Canada is the <u>second-largest </u> country in the world, after Russia. By land area alone, however, Canada ranks fourth, due to having the world's largest proportion of fresh water lakes. Stretching from the Atlantic Ocean in the east, Arctic Ocean to the north, and to the Pacific Ocean in the west, Canada has the longest coastline in the world, with a total length of 243,042 kilometres, and occupies much of the continent of North America.</p>

	<p class="three">
		Canada ranks <u>38th</u> by population, comprising about 0.5% of the world's total, with over <u>37 million</u> Canadians as of 2019. Being, however, the fourth-largest country by land area (second-largest by total area), the vast majority of the country is sparsely inhabited, with most of its population south of the 55th parallel north and more than half of Canadians live in just two provinces: Ontario and Quebec. The historical growth of Canada's population is complex and has been influenced in many different ways, such as indigenous populations, expansion of territory, and human migration. Being a new world country, immigration has been, and remains, the most important factor in Canada's population growth.</p>

	<center><em><h2>Culture</h2></em></center>
	<p class="four">Canada's culture draws influences from its broad range of constituent nationalities, and policies that promote a "just society" are constitutionally protected. Canada has placed emphasis on equality and inclusiveness for all its people. <u>Multiculturalism</u> is often cited as one of Canada's significant accomplishments, and a key distinguishing element of Canadian identity. In Quebec, cultural identity is strong, and there is a French Canadian culture that is distinct from English Canadian culture. However, as a whole, Canada is, in theory, a cultural mosaic—a collection of regional ethnic subcultures.</p>
